# Welcome to TrinovaQ Studio

**TrinovaQ Studio** is a specialized Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed for automotive and embedded software developers. It bridges the gap between legacy C development (MISRA compliance) and modern Rust safety features.

The tool provides a unified interface for coding, static analysis, hardware register manipulation, and serial debugging, all wrapped in a "Safety-First" UX.

## Core Capabilities

* **Hybrid Language Support**: Seamless switching between C (Embedded) and Rust.
* **The "Error Doctor"**: An intelligent analysis engine that translates compiler errors into automotive risk assessments.
* **Visual Safety Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of RAM usage, logic complexity, and safety violations.
* **Hardware Abstraction**: Interactive register bit-banging and mock flashing workflows.

## Getting Started
